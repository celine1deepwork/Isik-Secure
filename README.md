Işık'ta Güvendeyiz – A Campus Safety Solution

Scope:
"Işık'ta Güvendeyiz" is a comprehensive project aiming to enhance the safety and security measures within the İşık University campus. The project entails the development of a mobile application that facilitates real-time location sharing, quick communication with the security unit, and personal safety monitoring for students and staff. This application will be built using Flutter, an open-source UI software development kit by Google, which enables a seamless, natively compiled experience for both iOS and Android platforms from a single codebase.

Aims:
The primary goal of "Işık'ta Güvendeyiz" is to establish an elevated standard of safety by allowing users to:
- Report emergencies and hazards with varying degrees of severity.
- Communicate directly with the campus security unit via the application.
- Access precautionary information and guidelines for safety.
- Manage personal safety settings and preferences.

Duration:
The project is scheduled to span over 9 months, segmented into three key developmental phases:
- The first three months will focus on research, defining system requirements, and initial project planning.
- The subsequent three months are dedicated to design, prototyping, and the start of coding activities.
- The final three months will emphasize feature completion, integration, exhaustive testing, and user acceptance trials.

Usage of Flutter and Pages:
Flutter's robust framework will be utilized to construct a series of intuitively navigable screens or 'pages' within the application, such as:
- Sign Up Page: For new users to create their account using their İşık University email, ensuring secure access. This page will also facilitate password resets and include social media account integration for enhanced user engagement.
- Main Dashboard: Serving as the application's home page that provides quick access to all features including emergency reporting, location services, and security alerts.
- Settings Page: Allowing users to personalize their profile, change/reset passwords, configure language preferences, and manage their account.

Widgets and Functionality:
Flutter's widget-based architecture will be employed to incorporate various functionalities, such as:
- Security Level Widgets: To classify the severity of a reported hazard and initiate appropriate protocols.
- GPS Location Widgets: To provide precise location tracking in case of an emergency.
- Communication Widgets: To enable in-app messaging and alerts with the security unit.
- Profile Management Widgets: Including forms and dialogs for personal information updates and account management.
- Language Switch Widget: Introduced to cater to a diverse demographic, supporting multiple language options.

In summary, "Işık'ta Güvendeyiz" is set to be a pivotal asset in ensuring the well-being of all İşık University community members. The adoption of Flutter for development promises a reliable, effective, and user-friendly application that strengthens the University’s commitment to campus safety.
